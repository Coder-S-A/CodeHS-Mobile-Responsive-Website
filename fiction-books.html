                    <p>
                        In the place once known as North America lies the nation of 
                        Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by twelve outlying districts. 
                        The Capitol is cruel and keeps the districts in line by forcing 
                        them all to send one teen boy and one teen girl to participate 
                        in the annual Hunger Games, a fight to the death on live TV.  
                        Katniss Everdeen's youger sister, Primrose Everdeen, is chosen 
                        to go, Katniss volunteers to go instead. This is the story of 
                        the 74th annual Hunger Games

                    <p>
                        In a futuristic Chicago, society is divided into 5 factions. 
                        Abnegation the selfless, Dauntless the brave, Erudite the intelligent, 
                        Candor the honest, and Amity the peaceful. Tris learns 
                        she's Divergent, meaning she's a mix of factions, and won't 
                        fit in. When she discovers a plot to destroy Divergents, 
                        Tris and a boy called Four must find out what makes Divergents 
                        dangerous before it's too late. This is the story of the Divergent.

                        The Giver is a story of a brilliant boy named Jonas who happens 
                        to live in a society that is being controlled by the rules and 
                        tradition of The Elders. Through his wisdom and mannerism, Jonas 
                        is selected as the Receiver of Memory, who is know as the giver. 
                        This post distinguishes him from others and gives him authority. 
                        He follows the rules and receives wisdom in the form of memories, 
                        but what he sees upsets him. This, is the story of the Giver.
